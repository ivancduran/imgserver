What is it?
-----------
A Go library to crop images.

Cutter was initially developped to be able
to crop image resized using github.com/nfnt/resize.

Usage
-----

Read the doc on https://godoc.org/github.com/oliamb/cutter

Import package with

    import "github.com/oliamb/cutter"

Package cutter provides a function to crop image.

By default, the original image will be cropped at the
given size from the top left corner.

    croppedImg, err := cutter.Crop(img, cutter.Config{
      Width:  250,
      Height: 500,
    })

It is possible to specify the top left position:

    croppedImg, err := cutter.Crop(img, cutter.Config{
      Width:  250,
      Height: 500,
      Anchor: image.Point{100, 100},
      Mode:   TopLeft, // optional, default value
    })

The Anchor property can represents the center of the cropped image
instead of the top left corner:


    croppedImg, err := cutter.Crop(img, cutter.Config{
      Width: 250,
      Height: 500,
      Mode: Centered,
    })

The default crop use the specified dimension, but it is possible
to use Width and Heigth as a ratio instead. In this case,
the resulting image will be as big as possible to fit the asked ratio
from the anchor position.

    croppedImg, err := cutter.Crop(baseImage, cutter.Config{
      Width: 4,
      Height: 3,
      Mode: Centered,
      Options: Ratio,
    })

About resize
------------
This lib only manage crop and won't resize image, but it works great in combination with [github.com/nfnt/resize](https://github.com/nfnt/resize)
